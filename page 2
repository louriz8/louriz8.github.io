		<h1 style=" position: absolute;left:300px; top:10px;">-MOON LANDING-</h1>
		<h2 style=" position: absolute;left:100px; top:150px;">Space Race</h2>
		<h3 style=" position: absolute;left:100px; top:250px;">The Space Race was a defining competition between the United States <br> and the Soviet Union during the mid-20th century, marked by a fervent <br> quest for supremacy in space exploration and technology. <br><br>

Beginning in the late 1950s, it was propelled by political, military, <br> and ideological tensions of the Cold War era. The launch of the Soviet <br> satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957 marked the start of this intense rivalry, <br> triggering fear and astonishment in the West. The subsequent milestones, <br> including Yuri Gagarin's orbit around the Earth in 1961 and the Apollo 11 <br> moon landing in 1969, captivated the world and showcased the technological <br> prowess of both nations. <br><br> 

 As the rivalry intensified, each milestone reached <br> by one nation spurred the other to push the boundaries <br> further, driving rapid progress in space exploration. <br> The competition extended beyond the realm of <br> scientific achievement, becoming a symbol of ideological <br> superiority between the capitalist and communist blocs. <br> This fervent race led to significant technological <br>  advancements, including the development of <br> intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),<br> which would later shape global geopolitics.

		<h3 style=" position: absolute;left:100px; top:975px;"> <br><br> However, amidst the fervor of competition, there were also moments of <br> cooperation. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, both the United States <br> and the Soviet Union engaged in limited diplomatic exchanges and joint <br> ventures in space exploration. Notable examples include the Apollo-Soyuz <br> Test Project in 1975, where American and Soviet spacecraft docked in orbit,<br> symbolizing a brief detente amid the Cold War.<br> <br> 

The legacy of the Space Race endures as a testament to humanity's collective<br> ambition to explore the unknown and push the boundaries of what is possible. <br> It serves as a reminder of the power of scientific discovery to transcend <br> political divides and inspire generations to dream of reaching for the stars. <br> Today, as nations collaborate on international space missions and private <br> companies embark on ambitious space exploration projects, the spirit of the Space <br> Race lives on, driving us ever closer to unlocking the mysteries of the universe.</h3>

		<h3 style=" position: absolute;left:100px; top:12500px;"> Chang'e 3 (China)<br><br>
Chang'e 3 made a soft landing on the Moon at 13:12<br> UTC on December 14, 2013. This was the world's <br>first lunar soft landing since Luna 24 on August 22, <br>1976, and China's first soft landing on another <br> celestial body. The mission began operating on<br> December 1st, 2013. The Yutu rover was launched<br> by the lander following the successful landing, and it<br> traveled 114 meters before a system error rendered <br>it immobile. But the rover continued to function until July 2016.<br><br></h3>

		<h3 style=" position: absolute;left:400px; top:13035px;">Chang'e 4 became the first spacecraft to land on the<br> Moon's far side on January 3, 2019, at 2:26 UTC. <br>Chang'e 4 was initially intended to be Chang'e 3's backup.<br> Following Chang'e 3's success, it was subsequently modified <br> to become a mission to the far side of the Moon.<br> Following a successful landing in the Von Kármán crater,<br> the Chang'e 4 lander started the first-ever close <br>exploration of the Moon's far side by deploying the <br> 140-kilogram (310 lb) Yutu-2 rover.<br><br></h3>

<h3 style=" position: absolute;left:100px; top:13340px;">A few months before the landing, Queqiao, a relay satellite, was launched to the <br>Earth-Moon L2 Lagrangian point to facilitate communications between the far <br>side and Earth because the Moon inhibits communication between them.<br><br><br>

Beresheet (Israel/SpaceIL)<br><br>

Intending to make a soft landing, Israeli private space company SpaceIL launched <br> its spacecraft Beresheet on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida on February <br> 22, 2019. On April 11, 2019, SpaceIL lost communication with the spacecraft<br> during its final descent; a major engine failure caused it to crash.<br><br><br>

Chandrayaan-2 (India)<br><br>

On July 22, 2019, the Indian National Space Agency, or ISRO, launched <br> Chandrayaan-2. The orbiter, lander, and rover were its three main modules.<br> Scientific equipment from US and Indian research institutes was included in<br> each of these modules. After a difficult braking phase, communication with the<br> Vikram lander was lost on September 7, 2019, at a height of 2.1 kilometers <br>(1.3 mi). It was eventually determined that Vikram had crashed and burned up.<br><br><br>

Luna 25 (Russia)<br><br>

On August 19, 2023, the Luna 25 spacecraft failed during "pre-landing" maneuvers <br> and crashed onto the lunar surface, marking Russia's first lunar landing attempt <br>since 1976 and the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br><br><br>
